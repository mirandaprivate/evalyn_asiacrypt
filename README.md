## Status and reproducibility

This repository is a frozen snapshot intended for reproducing the paper's experiments. It will not receive further updates. We are continuing active development privately, and a commercial version will be released later. For reproduction, please use this snapshot as-is; issues and PRs may not be triaged.

cargo build --workspace
```

### Verify Build

```

## Running the Artifact

### Neural Network Example (Main Experiment)

#### Fast Demo (depth=16, default configuration)
The current code is configured for a fast demonstration with 16 layers:

```bash
# Run with optimal settings (recommended)
RAYON_NUM_THREADS=64 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn

# Run with fewer threads for limited hardware
RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn
```

**Current default settings:**
- Depth: 16 layers (defined by `const DEPTH: usize = 16;`)  
- Shape: 1024×1024 matrices per layer
- Expected runtime: ~5 minutes (with 8 threads)
- Peak memory: ~4GB

#### Full Paper Results (depth=1024)
To reproduce the exact paper results with 1024 layers, modify the code:

1. **Edit `composite/example/experiment_nn.rs`:**
   ```rust
   // Change line 11 from:
   const DEPTH: usize = 16;
   // To:
   const DEPTH: usize = 1024;
   ```

2. **Rebuild and run:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace --release
   RAYON_NUM_THREADS=64 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn
   ```

**Paper configuration settings:**
- Depth: 1024 layers
- Shape: 1024×1024 matrices per layer  
- Expected runtime: ~35-37 minutes (with 64 threads)
- Peak memory: ~256GB

### Configuration Options
- **Thread Control**: Set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` to limit parallel execution
- **Memory Optimization**: Use `--features jemalloc` for better memory management
- **Output**: All results are displayed in the console output


## Quantization modes (8-bit vs 16-bit)

The code supports two quantization configurations for the NN example:

- 8-bit (default in this repo snapshot)
	- `mat/src/lib.rs`: `pub type MyShortInt = i8;`
	- `poly-commit/src/lib.rs`: `pub type MyInt = i32;`

- 16-bit
	- Change `mat/src/lib.rs`:
		- from `pub type MyShortInt = i8;`
		- to   `pub type MyShortInt = i16;`
	- Change `poly-commit/src/lib.rs`:
		- from `pub type MyInt = i32;`
		- to   `pub type MyInt = i64;`

Rebuild the workspace after making changes.

## Network Depth Configuration

### Current Default (depth=16)
The repository is configured by default to run a fast demonstration with 16 layers:
- File: `composite/example/experiment_nn.rs`
- Line 11: `const DEPTH: usize = 16;`
- Purpose: Quick validation and demonstration (~5 minutes runtime)

### Paper Results (depth=1024)
To reproduce the full paper results with 1024 layers:

1. **Modify the depth constant:**
   ```rust
   // In composite/example/experiment_nn.rs, line 11
   // Change from:
   const DEPTH: usize = 16;
   // To:
   const DEPTH: usize = 1024;
   ```

2. **Rebuild and run:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace --release
   RAYON_NUM_THREADS=64 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn
   ```

### System Requirements by Configuration
- **depth=16**: 8GB RAM minimum, ~5 minutes runtime (8 threads)
- **depth=1024**: 256GB RAM minimum, ~35-37 minutes runtime (64 threads)

**Note**: The depth=1024 configuration requires substantial computational resources and is intended for reproducing the exact paper benchmarks.

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests across the workspace (recommended)
cargo test --workspace --release
```

### Run Tests for Specific Crates
```bash
# Test atomic proof protocols
cargo test -p atomic_proof --release

# Test matrix operations and utilities
cargo test -p mat --release

# Test composite protocols
cargo test -p composite --release

# Test Fiat-Shamir transcript functionality
cargo test -p fsproof --release

# Test polynomial commitment schemes
cargo test -p ark-poly-commit --release
```

### Test Output Interpretation
- All tests should pass for a correct setup
- Test failures may indicate environment issues or missing dependencies
- Some tests may be resource-intensive and take several minutes to complete

## Experimental Results

### System and Setup

We conducted experiments on an Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance equipped with 64 Intel Xeon 6982P-C (x86_64) vCPUs clocked between 0.8–3.9 GHz and 256 GB RAM. The server has a 504 MB shared L3 cache and runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Linux kernel 5.15).

### Model Configurations

#### Fast Demo Configuration (depth=16, default)
- **Layers**: 16 layers (for quick demonstration)
- **Layer transformation**: Y = sigmoid(W X + B)
- **Matrix dimensions**: 1024×1024 per layer
- **Parameters per layer**: 1,049,600 (1024×1024 + 1024)
- **Total parameters**: ~16.8 million
- **Expected performance**:
  - Runtime: ~5 minutes (with RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8)
  - Peak RAM: ~4GB
  - Proof size: ~87KB

#### Paper Results Configuration (depth=1024)
- **Layers**: 1024 layers (full paper experiments)
- **Layer transformation**: Y = sigmoid(W X + B)  
- **Matrix dimensions**: 1024×1024 per layer
- **Parameters per layer**: 1,049,600 (1024×1024 + 1024)
- **Total parameters**: ~2^30 (approximately 1.07 billion)

Where for each layer:
- W: A 1024×1024 weight matrix, quantized to 8-bit integers
- X: A 1024-dimensional input vector, quantized to 8-bit integers  
- Y: A 1024-dimensional output vector
- B: A 1024-dimensional bias vector, quantized to 8-bit integers

|-------------------------------------|----------:|-----------:|
| Auxiliary input commitment          | 733.08    | 755.61     |

| v.s Unverified computation          | 3.53      | 4.64       |

### Notes on measurement

- Build with `--release` and set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` explicitly.
- All output is displayed directly in the console.
- Both PoP proving and Fiat-Shamir transform proving invokes Groth16 prover, which we havent turn on the parallel feature  

### Notes on RAM usage

- Peak RAM is roughly proportional to the total number of NN parameters.
- Introducing intermediate (per-layer or per-block) commitments partitions a large model into smaller sub-NNs, reducing the prover's peak RAM.
- However, decomposing a large NN into smaller components increases the overall proof size and the verifier time.

## Interpreting Output

### Neural Network Experiment Output
The `experiment_nn` example produces detailed timing and memory usage statistics:

#### Key Metrics
- **Commitment time**: Time to commit to model parameters and structure
- **Prover time**: Total time for zero-knowledge proof generation
- **Proof size**: Size of the generated proof
- **Verifier time**: Time required for proof verification
- **Peak RAM**: Maximum memory consumption during execution

#### Output Format
- **Console output**: Real-time progress and summary statistics displayed directly in the terminal
- **Results**: All timing measurements, memory usage, and performance metrics are printed to stdout

#### Performance Interpretation
- **Baseline comparison**: "v.s Unverified computation" shows overhead factor
- **Component breakdown**: Detailed timing for each proof generation phase
- **Memory usage**: Peak RAM indicates scalability limits

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows/WSL Recommendations
- **WSL2 required**: Native Windows performance is suboptimal for Rayon parallelism
- **Thread control**: Set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable in bash:
  ```bash
  # Recommended for reproduction (matches paper experiments)
  RAYON_NUM_THREADS=64 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn
  
  # For limited hardware
  RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8 cargo run --release -p composite --features jemalloc --example experiment_nn
  ```

#### Linux Recommendations
- **Native performance**: Optimal execution environment
- **Memory management**: Monitor system memory usage during large experiments
- **Core scaling**: Performance scales approximately linearly with CPU core count
